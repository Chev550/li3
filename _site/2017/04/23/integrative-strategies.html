<h4 id="integrative-process">Integrative process</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>A big focus in LEED is on the integrative process - what is and who is involved, and what problems it solves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>What happens in a LEED charrette?</strong></p>

<p>A Charrette is a type of workshop where participants combine brainstorming, discussion, and strategy development to create a shared vision, goals and understanding of the next steps for a project, organization or community. During the Charrette, LEED goals are communicated to all team members, and LEED credit feasibility is evaluated. The integrative process is discussed as well as credit synergies and how the team plans to communicate during the building and design process. The outcome of the Charrette should include a first draft of the LEED scorecard, a preliminary rating, and defining the roles of each member of the project team.</p>

<p><strong>How does the integrative process differ from conventional building?</strong></p>

<p>The integrative process requires collaboration among key stakeholders and design professionals from conception to completion.</p>

<p><strong>What additional steps are there in an integrative process?</strong></p>

<p>The project phases of an integrative process are different than the conventional process:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Pre-Design</em>: the most critical phase of the integrative process, which includes several new steps:
    <ul>
      <li>Life cycle approach</li>
      <li>Develop a clear statement of the project’s vision</li>
      <li>Define the green goals of the building</li>
      <li>Set priorities</li>
      <li>Select the project team</li>
      <li>Research green technologies and strategies</li>
      <li>Assign small task groups</li>
      <li>Define green building budget items</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Design</li>
  <li>Construction plans</li>
  <li>Bidding process</li>
  <li>Construction</li>
  <li>Commission and turnover</li>
  <li>Occupancy and <em>Recommissioning</em></li>
  <li><em>Building end of life reuse or demolition/recycle</em></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="integrative-project-team-members">Integrative project team members</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>While all team members should be part of the integrative process, some will be more involved than others during different parts of the project.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>What is the role of the facility manager?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Who should be invited to the LEED charrette?</strong></p>

<p>Participants in the Charrette usually include the owner, architects, engineers, consultants, contractors, landscape architect, commissioning agent, etc. Basically anyone involved with the construction or use of the building is a candidate for participation.</p>

<p><strong>What role does a LEED AP have on a project?</strong></p>

<hr />

<h4 id="standards-that-support-leed">Standards that support LEED</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many LEED prerequisites and credits have requirements that are based on meeting third party standards. LEED most often references ASHRAE standards 90.1, 62, and 55.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>What do the ASHRAE standards do, and where are they used?</strong></p>

<p>Several LEED credits and prerequisites require meeting the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc. ASHRAE (pronounced “ash-ray”) publishes a widely recognized series of standards and guidelines relating to energy consumption and HVAC systems &amp; issues every three years.</p>

<p><strong>What is the Green Seal standard, and what type of material does it address?</strong></p>

<p>Green Seal is an independent nonprofit organization that promotes the manufacture and sale of environmentally responsible consumer products. In LEED Green seal usually is used as the standard for low VOC materials and green cleaning.</p>

<p><strong>What is SMACNA and where is it used in the construction process?</strong></p>

<p>The Sheet Metal and Air Conditioning National Contractors Association (SMACNA) has a set of indoor air quality guidelines that are used to help manage air quality issues resulting from construction and renovation.</p>

<p><strong>What standard is used for certified wood?</strong></p>

<p>The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) is an international non-profit, multi-stakeholder organization that promotes responsible management of the world’s forests. LEED projects using wood certified by FSC can earn points in the Materials and Resources category.</p>
